# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

**What’s this?**  
This is a simple practice project to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn. Nothing fancy, just practicing the ANN muscles and learning how things work end-to-end with real-world styled data.

## Project Overview

The goal here is to predict if a bank customer will leave (churn) or stay loyal, based on their profile and behavior. The data includes features like credit score, geography, age, balance, number of products, and more.

*(Translation: This is a fun practice project — not a professional system!)*

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras for ANN  
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler)  
- Streamlit for building a quick, interactive UI  
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Make sure you have Python and all dependencies installed (use `requirements.txt`)  
3. Run the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
